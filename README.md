# Task details
## Backgroundâ€‹
You will be provided an XD file with screenshots a webpage we would like for you to build using angular
7+ along with the icon images.

This page will require you to design a side-navigation bar (blue) along with a light gray drawer that will
open when a button is pressed. The drawer contains 3 links.    

## What success looks like: 
First, we want to make sure you can bring this design to reality, so please make sure the final delivery is
as closer to the design as possible.   

Second, we want to make sure you are developing scalable, clean and elegant code.  So how you
design your components is just as important as the look & feel.

Use best practices, including ngrx/store methodologies you demonstrated previously.  The page has to
be responsive and as such you may use any front-end framework to achieve that such as Bootstrap.
